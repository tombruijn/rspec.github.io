title: RSpec Rails 4.0 has been released!
author: Benoit Tigeot, Jon Rowe and Phil Pirozhkov

RSpec Rails 4.0 has been released! Given our commitment to
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), this is a major release and as such
contains breaking changes. The major change is that we've dropped support for
Rails below 5, with only soft support for Rails 4.2.

As usual, if you notice any newly introduced bugs, please let us know,
and we'll release a fix for it ASAP.

RSpec continues to be a community-driven project with contributors
from all over the world. This release includes 258 commits and 56
merged pull requests from 27 different contributors!

Thank you to everyone who helped make this release happen!

## Notable Changes

Support for Rails 6, including support for testing ActionCable, ActiveMailbox.

### Breaking changes

RSpec Rails 4 only supports Rails 5 and 6. This is in line with our
new versioning policy which keeps major versions of RSpec Rails in
lockstep with supported versions of Rails.

This means that we no longer support versions of Ruby below 2.2
in line with the versions of Ruby supported by Rails 5.

We have restricted the version of Rails for this version to 4.2 to
allows a "soft support" for Rails 4.2 during this interim
period but we strongly urge you to upgrade Rails to use 4.0.0.

### Removed version lock with RSpec gems

The `rspec-rails` gem is no longer locked with the versioning of the other
RSpec gems, we will now be releasing `rspec-rails` with each new Rails
release, keeping in lockstep with their supported major versions.

### Improved JRuby support

We have improved JRuby support and RSpec Rails 4 fully supports JRuby on Rails 5 and 6.

### Support for Action Cable

We now support [channel specs][1] in order to easily test your Action Cable channels.
A `channel spec` pulls in `ActionCable::Channel::TestCase`, including all of the
behavior and assertions that it provides, in addition to RSpec's own behavior and
expectations.

### Support for Action Mailbox

Rails 6 adds [Action Mailbox][2] for dealing with inbound emails.
RSpec Rails 4 adds support for [mailbox specs][4] using the Rails
test helpers for mailboxes.

For example using the Rails test helper, `process` and the `have_been_delivered` matcher:

~~~ ruby
RSpec.describe InboxMailbox, type: :mailbox do
  it "marks email as delivered when number tag in subject is valid" do
    mail = Mail.new(
      from: "replies@example.com",
      subject: "[141982763] support ticket"
    )
    mail_processed = process(mail)

    expect(mail_processed).to have_been_delivered
  end
end
~~~

### Improvements to generators

If you use generators, there are some improvements:
- The default hash syntax is now the Ruby 1.9 style in generated files to match Rails conventions
- Request specs are generated instead of controller specs by default
- New [generators][3] available (channel, generator, mailbox...)

### Allow configuring Active Job `queue_adapter` in system specs

Some people want to run Active Job with a specific queue adapter. In system
specs you can now choose your desired queue adapter:

~~~ruby
before do
  ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter = :inline
end
~~~

### Silence log output with Puma

By default, Puma will no longer print logs when running system specs.

### Ability to manually turn off Active Record support

When using Rails without ActiveRecord or using an alternative ORM
or a database of choice, e.g. Sequel, ROM, Mongoid etc. We can
mistakenly detect ActiveRecord as being used due to other gems
autoloading the constants, we now support manually turning off
Active Record support when not configured with:
`config.use_active_record = false`
