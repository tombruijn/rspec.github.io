title: New RSpec Website!
author: Myron Marston
---

RSpec's website has been in need of a refresh for a long time. We've
been working on this new site, off and on, for more than a year, and
we're glad to finally ship it. We hope that it'll prove much
more useful to the community than the old site, particularly since it
now hosts our [documentation](/documentation) and our [blog](/blog).

I'd like to thank all the people who helped make this site happen:

* [Ninefold](https://ninefold.com/), who sponsored the development of
  the site and are covering its on-going costs.
* [Katie Chen](http://pistachiomade.com/), who came up with the logo and
  new design.
* [Andrew Harvey](http://mootpointer.com/),
  [Shamim Jahandideh](https://github.com/sjahandideh), and
  [Jon Rowe](http://jonrowe.co.uk/), who helped develop the site.
* [Carlos Rodriguez](http://cohitre.com/) and Brandon Renfrow, who helped out with the CSS.

While what we have now is a huge improvement, it's still not as polished
as we would like, and we're hoping folks from the community will chip in
and help us iteratively improve it. The blog in particular -- which I
helped put together -- is badly in need of some CSS improvements, but my
CSS skills are very poor.

If you'd like to help us out, head over to the [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/rspec/rspec.github.io) and either open an issue
to suggest improvements or submit a pull request.
