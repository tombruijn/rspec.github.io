title: Jon Rowe and Sam Phippen are RSpec's new leads
author: Myron Marston

My [first contribution to
RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/commit/cbd5a8a26885106e0483d189e9d39d80d58f7f77)
happened over 8 years ago, and I've [lead the project for nearly 6
years](http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/blog/2012/11/28/myron-marston-and-andy-lindeman-are-rspecs-new-project-leads/).
In that time, a lot has been accomplished:

* We shipped a dozen major or minor feature releases (plus
  [many](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-core/versions),
  [many](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-expectations/versions)
  [patch](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-mocks/versions)
  [releases](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-rails/versions))
* We added some of RSpec's most popular features (like [composable
  matchers](/blog/2014/01/new-in-rspec-3-composable-matchers/),
  [verifying doubles](https://rhnh.net/2013/12/10/new-in-rspec-3-verifying-doubles/), and
  [`--bisect`](/blog/2015/06/rspec-3-3-has-been-released/#core-bisect))
* I co-authored [a book about using RSpec
  effectively](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3)
* RSpec became [the most popular Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/stats) with over 300 million downloads

During that time, my life has also changed significantly:

* I changed employers from [Moz](https://moz.com/) to [Square](https://squareup.com/) last year
* I stopped using Ruby as my primary language about 3 years ago (at Moz we switched to
  [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and my team at Square is using Java)
* I have 3 kids now (when I started working on RSpec I didn't have any!)
* I no longer have the kind of time I used to to work on open source

As much as I have enjoyed working on RSpec for the better part of a decade, I
rarely have the time anymore, and when I do have the time, I often don't enjoy it.
I'm also no longer a regular user of RSpec.

In short, the time has come for me to take a step back from the project.
Effective immediately, Jon Rowe and Sam Phippen are the new co-leads of
RSpec. Both of them have been contributing to RSpec for years and I have
every confidence they will lead the project well.

Please join me in thanking Jon and Sam for stepping forward to lead the
project!
