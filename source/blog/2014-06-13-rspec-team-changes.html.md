title: RSpec Team Changes
author: Myron Marston

[Andy Lindeman](http://www.andylindeman.com/), who has been working on RSpec
with me for a couple years, has decided to retire from the RSpec core team.
In his current job at GitHub, he's using Ruby and Rails much less than
he used to. It has been really great to have the chance to work with Andy
over the last few years. I can't thank him enough. His work on
rspec-rails in particular (since he's been lead maintainer) has been
awesome. We wish him well in his future endeavors.

Meanwhile, [Aaron Kromer](http://aaronkromer.com/), who joined the team
a few months back, has volunteered to take responsibility as lead
rspec-rails maintainer. Aaron's already been doing a wonderful job.

Lastly, we have one more new team member -- [Yuji Nakayama](http://yujinakayama.me/).
If you've upgraded a code base from RSpec 2 to RSpec 3 you've probably
benefited from Yuji's great work on [transpec](http://yujinakayama.me/transpec/).
We're excited to have Yuji on the team.

Please join me in thanking Andy, and congratulating Aaron and Yuji!
