title: RSpec Team Changes
author: Myron Marston

The RSpec core team recently expanded to include three new members:

* [Bradley Schaefer](http://www.soulcutter.com/)
* [Jon Rowe](http://jonrowe.co.uk/)
* [Sam Phippen](http://samphippen.com/)

Bradley, Jon and Sam have all been doing great work reviewing pull
requests, triaging issues, fixing bugs, improving RSpec's documentation
and coding new features. We decided it was time to add them to the
team.

Meanwhile, [Chad Humphries](http://spicycode.com/), [Pat
Maddox](http://patmaddox.com/) and [Justin
Ko](https://github.com/justinko) have all chosen to retire from
the team and move on to other things.

Please join me in welcoming Bradley, Jon and Sam, and thanking Chad,
Pat and Justin for all of their contributions to RSpec!
